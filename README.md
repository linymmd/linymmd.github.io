# About me
I am a Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology Fellow at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. See my [Curriculum Vitae](https://linymmd.github.io/CV_YMLin.pdf). Prior to this role, I completed my residency training in diagnostic radiology at Taipei Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan. I actively participate in various clinical research projects, focusing on the application of innovative diagnostic imaging tools and minimally invasive image-guided treatments for cancer patients. I love music, cycling, jogging, and travel.
